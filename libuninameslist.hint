ldesc: "The Unicode consortium provides a file containing annotations on 
many unicode characters. This library contains a compiled version of 
this file so that programs can access these data easily. The library 
contains a very large (sparse) array with one entry for each unicode 
code point (U+0000 - U+10FFFF). The library also contains a (much 
smaller) list of all the Unicode blocks."
